GPS Location Integration into Google Maps
The GNSS enabled family of Siretta Industrial Modems provide GPS position information in the Decimal Minutes format which is presented as ddmm.mmmm for latitude and dddmm.mmmm for longitude. When integrating in to your application using Google Maps to display your position you must provide the information in the Decimal Degrees format which is presented as dd.dddd for latitude and dd.dddd for longitude.

The AT command AT$GPSACP will return the lat/long position information in the Decimal Minutes format:

GPSACP lat is in the format ddmm.mmmm
GPSACP lon is in the format dddmm.mmmm

Position Information Conversion
This position information can easily be converted into Google Maps compatible lat/long readings as shown below:

Strip the dd from the message i.e.

ddmm.mmmm

Which becomes

variable1 = dd
variable2 = mm.mmmm
variable3 = variable2 / 60

Rejoin values to make dd.dddd

dd.dddd = variable1.variable3

i.e. Latitude / Longitude for the Siretta office from NMEA GGA message to lat/lon!

Lat: ddmm.mmmm: 5123.1355 (N)
Lat: dd + mm.mmmm: 51 + 23.1355
Lat: dd + dd.dddd: 51 + (23.1355 / 60) 0.38559
Lat: dd.dddd: 51.38559

Lat: 51.38559 (As this is north it is positive, south is negative)

Long: dddmm.mmmm: 00058.4350 (W)
Long: ddd + mm.mmmm: 000 + 58.4350
Long: ddd + dd.dddd: 000 + (58.4350 / 60) 0.9739
Long: ddd.dddd: 000.9739

Long: -000.9739 (As this is west it is negative, east is positive)

$GPGGA,170243.00,3401.20701,N,11824.6820,W,1,06,2.14,70.9,M,-32.9,M,,*51

Notice that latitude is 3401.20701 while longitude is 11824.68206. This is not the floating-point decimal (##.######) format used in the White House example shown above. Rather, GPGGA, as well as other GPS sentence structures, use the dddmm.mmmm format for latitude and the dddmm.mmmm for longitude.

At first glance, you might think that the ddmm.mmmm and dddmm.mmmm formats represent a numeric value, but they do not. Rather these formats are a concatenation of numerals in which the position of each digit has a specific meaning.

In the ddmm.mmmm and dddmm.mmmm formats the dd and ddd digits indicate degrees. The mm.mmmm digits indicate the minute and fraction of a minute. Thus, the latitude expressed as 3401.21189 in ddmm.mmmn format, translates into 34.020196 in ##.##### format.

For those readers that like this sort of detail, Listing 2 below shows the conversion logic for the latitude 3401.21189 and longitude 11824.67797, from the ddmm.mmmm and dddmm.mmmm formats to standard decimal values.

For those architects designing mobile systems, identifying the standard by which to represent and consume GPS data is an important determination, particularly when youâ€™re passing data between systems and microservices. Developers writing programs that analyze GPGGA sentences or any of the other various GPS sentence formats will need to accommodate how latitude and longitude data are formatted. It can be a bit of a chore in terms of parsing.

The long and short of it is that you need to be aware of field formats when working with a specific GPS sentence.
